# Uncountable to accountable words — game of responsibilities.

Language wouldn’t be same, emotions are equal!

All of us have memories which was built over billions of small things and lots of chit chats so far. A wonderful time of life where we all would love to return and live again.

Going back in time is a most demanded but yet unrealistic wish of us. I feel, words, actions and hence moments we created are at its best. Unstoppable words and stories, made us unique, a genuine personality so far and still growing with boundries.
> Childhood was grooming us with freedom, now we are just growimg with time and responsibilities.

That time, freedom of words, no objections, no boundries, just laughs and happiness. You was real owner of your expressions and words, yet people don’t get hurt!

### Tied knot with purpose

Around age of 6–8 we know the purpose or imposed purposes and we look after horizons, with self-imagined win win worlds. Our purposes are holy same as our hearts and wills but, expressions gets boundries of ‘grammer’ a small thing which makes a language. Before this time whatever we say, people try to understand even with actions.

Later your purpose bounds to a dream and your words start getting shape for these. Do you remember, well polished speeches at schools? Grammer, languages, expressions came to help ‘how to say something?’

Most of us, may not speek in audience, we are same person who may lead 10–12 kids in many games in childhood, is language stopped us? I guess no, but boundries are emotions and feelings which stopped us and on other hand, response from audience.

### Then, Running out of words

All of us, someday came across this awkward moment. Choosing the right words, hence short of it. Expectations, reactions and appreciations or rejections from people put us in this struggle.
> Emotions controls you, right words define you.

Whenever you take responsibility of anything you need to be wise enough, to add emotions and choice of right words. Is that a boundry to stop us? I believe, responsibility is just a corrected recepie of what and how.

Just to narrate further, **What** defines situations or moments, **how** summarises your deal with it. It could be anything like words, reactions or silence everything is **accountable.**
